# Custom Food Textures

## How It Works
Food textures are loaded dynamically from:
```
textures/food/
```
When an `Apple` is created, it:

- Loads the image by filename
- Automatically scales it to the right size
- Draws it directly at its in-game position

There’s no tile grid, no layout rules, just one image per food.

## Image Guidelines
- Any shape or size works — it's scaled for you
- Transparent PNGs are supported
- Keep the aspect ratio `1:1` (e.g. 64×64)
- Center your design — it’s placed as-is on the game grid

## Example Custom Textures
- Create a new PNG (suggested: 64×64)
- Draw your food item
- Save to `textures/food/` with whatever name you like

To load a custom food texture you can just change the `FOOD_DEFAULT_TEXTURES` variable in the `config.toml` file to the name of the texture's file.
(e.g. FOOD_DEFAULT_TEXTURES = "custom.png")
